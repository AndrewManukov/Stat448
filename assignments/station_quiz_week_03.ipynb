    "The following questions should be completed with your mates at the station you decided to sit at today. Your station should designate one person to be the one who submits (commits/pushes) the answers to the quiz in their repo. We'll call this person the **designated submitter**. You all have 50 minutes (i.e. the end of class) to complete these questions. Do not change anything in this file above the line.\n",

Copy it into your personal repo to begin answering the questions, but rename the file as station_quiz_week_03_Netid.ipynb with your Netid. (GitHub)\n",
